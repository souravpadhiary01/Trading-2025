How to Install a DLL File:

- Copy the extracted .dll file to the installation folder of the application or game.

Check if the problem is solved.
If the problem persists or you are not sure which software is having problems, install the .DLL file directly to Windows.

- Copy the file to "C:\Windows\SysWOW64\" (32bit)
- Copy the file to "C:\Windows\System32\" (64bit)

You can install the .dll file in both system folders without any problems.
